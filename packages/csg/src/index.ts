/**
 * The CSG core: what the model is, and how a point in space is measured against it.
 *
 * One import for everything a worker or a mesher needs. The pieces are separable and individually
 * tested — operations, the tree, the field, the file format — and this barrel exists so that a
 * mesher does not have to know that, and so that a change to one does not force a change to the
 * other's imports.
 *
 * **The shapes are not in here.** They live in `@big-mesh-studios/sdf`, which this package
 * depends on, and the re-export below is for the convenience of a caller that already imports
 * the field: the boundary is real and a package can be moved across it, but a caller should not
 * have to learn which half of the vocabulary it came from. See ADR 0025 for what that boundary
 * buys.
 *
 * **The chunk size is not in here either, and was.** This barrel used to re-export
 * `VOXEL_SIZE`, `CHUNK_VOXELS`, `BLOCK_WORLD` and the rest from a single `constants.ts`, which
 * made the CSG one chunk size wide by accident — the chain ran through `CANDIDATE_CELL` into
 * `bvh.ts` without a single import saying so. Nothing imported those four through here, so
 * removing them broke no caller (ADR 0024).
 *
 * Nothing here imports the renderer or the DOM. That is deliberate and load-bearing: the operation
 * list is cloned into every meshing worker whenever it changes, and it crosses that boundary by
 * structured clone, which means it has to be plain data.
 * `docs/adr/0002-computed-field-never-stored.md` has the reasoning for why the model is a list of
 * primitives at all.
