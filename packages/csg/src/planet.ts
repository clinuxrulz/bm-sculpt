/**
 * A planet: the same landscape, folded onto a sphere.
 *
 * The field is
 *
 *     f(p) = |p| - (R + scale·g(n̂))
 *
 * with `n̂ = p / |p|` and `g` the 3D fBm from `perlin3.ts`. It is a drop-in for `terrainField`:
 * it satisfies `BaseField` by being a function of position and `SurfaceExtent` by answering
 * `couldHoldSurface`, and **nothing else in the engine knows which one it has.** That is the
 * property ADR 0004 has been buying since the landscape was a plane, and this is the first change
 * that spends it — the CSG fold, the operation BVH, the mesher, the picker and the worker
 * boundary are all untouched.
 *
 * ## The property that makes this easier than it looks
 *
 * **`n̂` does not change along a ray from the planet's centre.** So `f` restricted to any such ray
 * is `r - (R + scale·g)`: a perfect radial height field, one per direction, with no slope term
 * in the radial direction at all. Three things follow, and they are what the rest of this file is
 * built on.
 *
 * **The surface is a star-shaped radial graph**, so a ray from inside the planet meets it exactly
 * once on the way out, and sphere-tracing it is well behaved.
 *
 * **`∂f/∂r = 1` exactly.** The gradient is `n̂ - (scale/r)·P·∇g`, where `P = I - n̂n̂ᵀ` projects out
 * the radial component, so `n̂·∇f = 1` and the tangential correction is perpendicular to it:
 *
 *     |∇f|² = 1 + (scale/r)² · |P ∇g|²
 *
 * **And `r` cancels out of the Lipschitz bound**, because `S` is chosen to make one noise cell
 * `TERRAIN_FEATURE` world units across at the nominal radius. `(scale/r)·S = scale/TERRAIN_FEATURE`,
 * so the bound keeps the height field's own shape with `3` where it had `2` — three noise axes
 * rather than two — and nothing else changes.
 *
 * ## What is different from the height field, and why it is not worse
 *
 * - **The noise is three-dimensional.** Not for accuracy: for continuity. `perlin3.ts`'s header
 *   has the measurements.
 * - **The surface extent is a band of radii, not a range of heights.** `lowestRadius` and
 *   `highestRadius` replace `lowest` and `highest`, and `couldHoldSurface` answers from the exact
 *   minimum and maximum radius over a box — a distance-to-AABB and eight corners, which is the
 *   same cost class as the height field's two comparisons.
 * - **The bound is about as loose as the height field's.** `planet.test.ts` measures both.
 *
 * ## The planet is centred on the origin, deliberately
 *
 * **Because the chunk lattice is.** `chunkCellOf` is a per-axis floor around the world origin, and
 * a lattice re-centred on the planet would have to be rebuilt to put a planet anywhere else. The
 * alternative — a `centre` parameter — is one more thing that can disagree with the lattice, and
 * the win from being able to put a planet off-origin is not worth it until something asks for one.
 * See ADR 0036.
