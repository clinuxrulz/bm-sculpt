 * carried `base: "none" | "terrain"` beside an optional `terrain?: { origin; scale; octaves; seed }`,
 * on the reasoning that "a world with no base field cannot accidentally arrive with half of one".
 * It can: a message saying `"planet"` with a terrain's four numbers is exactly that mistake, and
 * nothing in the type stopped it. Here the parameters and the kind that selects them are the same
 * value, so there is no such message to write.
 *
 * **Plain data throughout, because it crosses into workers by structured clone.** A union of two
 * object literals survives that; a class instance becomes an object with its fields and none of
 * its methods, which looks like one and cannot sample.
