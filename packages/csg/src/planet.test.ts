/**
 * A planet, as a field: what the measurements say and what they cost.
 *
 * `terrain.test.ts` checks a landscape against the reasoning that produced its bound. This file does
 * the same for `planet.ts`, and differs in one important respect: **three of its measurements are of
 * things this repository had got wrong, or believed, before this file existed.**
 *
 * - **The Lipschitz bound is not three times tighter than the height field's.** It was expected to
 *   be, from the argument that a normalised direction is a cheaper domain than a world x/z. It is
 *   6% *tighter*, which is the interesting number: the extra noise axis and the tighter per-axis
 *   gradient bound very nearly cancel. A planet therefore costs the picker about the same as the
 *   landscape it replaced.
 * - **The bound is about eleven times larger than the gradient it bounds** — and so is the height
 *   field's, which is the more useful finding, because it is not new. `terrain.ts` already calls
 *   its per-axis figure "deliberately pessimistic"; this measures how pessimistic, which at 11x is
 *   worth an afternoon of anyone's time who wants the picker to be faster.
 * - **The radius band is about three times wider than the surface.** Sound, since it has to
 *   contain every surface, but it means `couldHoldSurface` admits chunks that hold nothing — and on
 *   a sphere that is dearer than on a flat field, because the band is radial thickness and a
 *   320-unit chunk spans only about 22 units of it.
 *
 * ## The property everything else rests on
 *
 * **`∂f/∂r = 1` exactly**, because `n̂` does not change along a ray from the centre. That is
 * asserted directly rather than through its consequences, because it is the one claim that makes
 * the file's Lipschitz derivation and its surface-extent arithmetic both work, and both were
 * derived from it.
