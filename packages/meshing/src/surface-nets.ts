/**
 * Naive Surface Nets.
 *
 * For every cell whose eight corner samples disagree on sign, emit **one** vertex,
 * placed at the average of the crossings along that cell's edges; then, for every
 * primal edge where the sign changes, emit a quad from the four cells sharing it.
 *
 * Chosen over marching cubes (ADR 0003) for three reasons that all matter here: one
 * vertex per cell rather than two to five triangles; no 256-entry table and no
 * ambiguous cases; and a surface that reads as smooth where marching cubes' reads as
 * voxelised.
 *
 * ## The seam rule, and why it is the only subtle thing here
 *
 * A chunk owns a range of **cells**, and a quad belongs to a primal **edge**. The
 * four cells around an edge straddle chunk boundaries — the edge at the interface has
 * cells on either side of it — so "each chunk meshes its own cells" does not say who
 * emits the interface quads. Both halves would, or neither would, and both produce a
 * visible artefact: duplicated geometry, or a crack.
 *
 * The rule is: **each chunk owns the edges lying within its own cells' span, and
 * takes the four cells it needs from one cell of padding on the low side.**
 *
 *     a chunk owning cells [base, base + n) emits edges at [base, base + n)
 *
 * Neighbouring chunks therefore emit consecutive, disjoint runs, every edge in the
 * world is emitted exactly once, and no stitching is involved. The reference
 * implementation states the same property in one line — *faces are not generated on a
 * chunk's positive boundaries* — and this is the same rule written as what each chunk
 * *does* rather than what it avoids.
 *
 * ## Index layout
 *
 * With `n` samples a chunk owns per axis, and `O` the world position of its own first
 * sample's voxel:
 *
 * - the sample array holds `n + 2` per axis, indices `0 .. n + 1`
 * - sample `s` is at world `O + (s - 1)`, so indices `1 .. n` are the chunk's own
 * - cell `c` spans samples `c` and `c + 1`, so cell `c` is the cell of world voxel
 *   `O + c - 1`, and there are `n + 1` cells, indices `0 .. n`
 * - cell `0` is therefore one cell of **low padding**, and exists only to give the
 *   interface edges their vertices
 * - an edge leaves grid point `p` toward `p + e`; the four cells sharing it all have
 *   index `p` on the edge's own axis, and `p - 1` or `p` on each of the other two
 *
 * Those four-cell indices are what fix the loop ranges. `p` must be `1 .. n` on the
 * edge's own axis to be owned, and `1 .. n` on the other two so that `p - 1` still
 * names a cell. One range, both reasons.
 *
 * ## A chunk may own cells outside its own extent
 *
 * `extra` widens the run of owned cells per axis, to `1 .. n + extra`, and everything
 * above follows from that: the grid is two larger than the run rather than than `n`, and
 * the grid is rectangular rather than cubic, so the strides come off the cell counts
 * instead of off one `cells`.
 *
 * The run still *begins* at `origin`, so a caller whose extra cell lies below its chunk
 * says so by lowering `origin` rather than by asking for a negative index. That is the
 * whole reason the parameter is a count per axis and not a range: a chunk reaching into
 * its neighbour on one face should own one extra cell, not a shell of them.
