/**
 * A running session: a model, a chunk window, a pool of meshing workers, and the store
 * that holds what comes back.
 *
 * This is where the phases meet. Phases 1 to 4 each built a piece that is testable on its
 * own and useless alone; nothing here is new logic, only the wiring — and the wiring is
 * where the interesting failures live, because each piece enforces its own invariant and
 * the seam between two correct pieces is not automatically correct.
 *
 * Three of those seams carry a decision worth stating up front.
 *
 * **A mesh reply is applied at the revision recorded when it was requested, not at the
 * slot's current revision.** The slot that asked is looked up from a record made at
 * request time, not from the window's present answer. Between the two, the window may
 * have scrolled and given that slot to a different cell — and applying the mesh anyway
 * would draw one chunk's surface at another's coordinates. The store refuses it; this is
 * what it refuses.
 *
 * **A cell leaving the window is abandoned in the pool, not merely dropped.** The pool
 * queues by cell and the window forgets by slot, so without this the queue fills with work
 * for cells nobody is waiting for, and the pool's cancellation line never advances.
 *
 * **The model is sent on change, not per chunk.** Every worker builds its own field, so
 * every worker needs the operations. Sending them per chunk would re-serialise the model
 * once per chunk; sending on change makes it once per edit.
