/**
 * Compiling a material needs no graphics device.
 *
 * `NodeMaterial.build` turns the node graph into roots plus the exact set of bindings
 * the graph reaches, and `compileGlsl` renders those to GLSL ES 3.00. Both are
 * host-side string and object work, so the questions worth asking about a shader this
 * size are answerable here rather than by looking at a sky.
 *
 * What this cannot see is whether the sky is any good. A march that compiles, marches
 * the right number of steps through the right slab and integrates its transmittance
 * analytically can still produce a grey sheet, and only a browser will show that. So
 * these are about the failures that are *silent* — a fetch the compiler could not
 * see it had already made, an accumulator mutated by assignment rather than by
 * `mul`, a `NaN` from JavaScript arithmetic leaking into a uniform, a march that
 * starts at the eye instead of at the volume.
 *
 * The bake is at a reduced size. Its resolution changes nothing about the shader, and
 * a full one is two and a half seconds.
