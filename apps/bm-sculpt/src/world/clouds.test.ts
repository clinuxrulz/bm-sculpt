/**
 * Compiling a material needs no graphics device.
 *
 * `NodeMaterial.build` turns the node graph into roots plus the exact set of bindings
 * the graph reaches, and `compileGlsl` renders those to GLSL ES 3.00. Both are
 * host-side string and object work, so the questions worth asking about a shader this
 * size are answerable here rather than by looking at a sky.
 *
 * What this cannot see is whether the sky is any good. A march that compiles, marches
 * the right number of steps through the right slab and integrates its transmittance
 * analytically can still produce a grey sheet, and only a browser will show that. So
 * these are about the failures that are *silent* — a fetch the compiler could not
 * see it had already made, an accumulator mutated by assignment rather than by
 * `mul`, a `NaN` from JavaScript arithmetic leaking into a uniform, a march that
 * starts at the eye instead of at the volume.
 *
 * The bake is at a reduced size. Its resolution changes nothing about the shader, and
 * a full one is two and a half seconds.

/**
 * Whether the defaults produce weather at all.

 * want to look at. That question was open until a player loaded the game and reported
 * clear sky overhead, and the answer turned out to be neither the field nor the tuning:
 * the layer had never been built, because the bake's promise settled nowhere and
 * nothing in the application said so.
 *
 * So this block answers the question the others cannot. It **transcribes the shader's
 * own arithmetic** into plain numbers — coverage gates the base shape, detail erodes
 * inside it, and the result is integrated against the extinction the shader uses — and
 * runs it over a grid of rays at the material's defaults. A transcription can drift from
 * the shader, and this one did for most of its life: six separate ways, listed at
 * `alphaOfRay`, each of which survived because the field is self-similar and a
 * self-similar field forgives almost any addressing error. What it asserts is about the
 * *defaults and their direction*, which is a property of the two knobs, while the tests
 * above own the shader's shape.
 *
 * Measured at the defaults before the address was fixed, and the numbers the assertions
 * were written against: mean alpha 0.50, half the rays carrying cloud, none of it a solid
 * sheet. After: **mean alpha 0.328, 33% cloudy, 33% solid** — a third fewer cloudy rays,
 * and a much sharper split between them. The reduction is the point: a ray that sweeps the
 * volume meets the threshold along its length or it does not, so the sky broke up instead
 * of hazing over. The sharpness is discussed, measured and left alone at the assertion

/**
 * How far the address *moves* along a ray, which is the question no other test here was
 * asking.
 *
 * Every other assertion in this file is about the address's **shape**: that it is scaled by
 * the sea radius, that the weather wraps once, that the altitude is divided by the thickness.
 * All three held while the layer was addressed by direction alone, and the sky was smooth and
 * structureless — because the address was *correct* and did not go anywhere. A direction is
 * scale-invariant, so a ray marching through the layer moves it by a few thousandths of a
 * tile, and a sixty-texel volume read at that rate is one texel: the same base shape and the
 * same three detail channels, sixty times over, with only the one-dimensional height profile
 * varying between them.
 *
 * So this is arithmetic rather than a regex, and it is the test that had to exist. It asks how
 * many texels of the volume a ray actually reads on its way through the layer, from the eye
 * heights a player stands at and along the elevations they look, and it holds the answer to
 * something the volume can resolve: its **finest** detail cell is
 * `SHAPE_SIZE / SHAPE_DETAIL_PERIODS[2]` texels, and a ray that crosses less than one of
 * those is a ray that never sees an edge.
 *
 * **What this catches and what the tests above catch, because they are not the same thing.**
 * This one is written against the *rule*, in plain arithmetic — it cannot see the shader, and
 * deleting the altitude from `shapeAt` leaves every assertion in it green. The two regex
 * assertions in "the shell's address" are what bind the shader to the rule, and they are
 * verified to fail when the altitude is dropped from either the march or the light march. The
 * division is deliberate: the regexes pin the shape of the address and would happily pin a
 * useless one, while this pins the number that address has to produce and knows nothing about
 * how it is spelled. Together they are the pair the bug needed and only had neither of.
 *
 * Measured, at the eye height a player actually stands at (11) and the layer's constants:
 * a vertical ray across the layer now reads **60.0 texels** of the volume, from 60.1 at
 * thirty degrees of elevation to 61.8 at two. Addressed by direction alone it read 0.00 and
 * 0.37 respectively — a fortieth of a texel and a two-hundredth — because the whole of the
 * seven hundred units of the crossing went into the altitude and none of it into the address.
 *
 * The two halves of the address are counted separately because they answer different
 * questions. The direction half is what keeps the layer seamless and pole-free and is *supposed*
 * to be nearly still — a small drift with elevation is the price, and it is the correct price.
 * The altitude half is the one that was missing, and it is the one that has to deliver the
 * layer's whole vertical structure.
