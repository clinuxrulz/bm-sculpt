/**
 * Clouds: a raymarched **spherical shell** of volumetrics wrapped around the planet.
 *
 * ## Why this is a march and not a textured plane
 *
 * The version this replaces was a hundred-thousand-unit plane at a fixed altitude
 * carrying a tileable 2D noise texture, thresholded. It read correctly, and it tiled
 * every three thousand world units — which is the point at which the eye finds the
 * period and the sky stops being weather. Removing the repetition meant removing the
 * plane: a cloud needs a third dimension to have a silhouette, and a silhouette is
 * what makes it a cloud rather than fog with holes in it.
 *
 * ## The shell, and why the layer stopped being a slab
 *
 * A slab between two horizontal planes is a sky for a *flat* world. On a planet the
 * layer has to be two concentric spheres — `seaRadius + CLOUD_BOTTOM` and
 * `seaRadius + CLOUD_TOP` — or the "clouds" stand off the ground on one side and sink
 * into it on the other, and the far side of the planet has none at all. The march is
 * unchanged in spirit; only the entry and exit are solved against two spheres instead
 * of two planes, and the density field is addressed by **direction from the planet's
 * centre and altitude** instead of by world `x`/`z` and `y`.
 *
 * ## The geometry, and why the ordering is the occlusion scheme
 *
 * A large sphere centred on the camera, back faces only, no depth write, added to the
 * scene **last**. That ordering is the whole of it and it costs nothing: terrain is
 * drawn before it with depth writes on, so wherever a mountain is in front the
 * carrier's fragments are depth-rejected and the cloud is simply not there. A depth
 * texture would be the other way to do it and rmsl has none.
 *
 * The carrier is centred on the eye *exactly*, with no snapping, and that is not a
 * detail. The ray direction is `normalize(positionWorld - cameraPosition)`, so with
 * the carrier dead-centre that difference is identical for every pixel however the
 * camera moves and the sky cannot swim as the player walks. The cloud *content* is
 * addressed on the planet and so stays planted over the ground, which was the one
 * thing the old plane got right and the reason to keep. The carrier sphere is only a
 * carrier: it is not where the clouds are, and its radius has no meaning beyond
 * sitting inside the camera's far plane.
 *
 * ## The march
 *
 * Forward, front to back, with the four things that make a volumetric cloud affordable
 * rather than a shader that costs four milliseconds:
 *
 * - **Two tiers of step**, decided from the base shape alone, which is an upper bound
 *   on the density at every point and so can only ever skip empty space. Guerrilla's
 *   original steps *backwards* on finding density so it cannot miss a thin cloud; a
 *   linear forward loop has nowhere to step back to, so the empty step is kept under
 *   two dense ones and the dither below covers the remainder.
 * - **Analytic integration.** Approximating transmittance as constant over a step makes
 *   brightness depend on how finely the volume was sampled, which is what forces small
 *   steps. Integrating it exactly — density constant, transmittance exponential —
 *   removes the coupling, and it is what buys the long empty steps. From
 *   *Optimisations for Real-Time Volumetric Cloudscapes*.
 * - **A dither on the first sample**, which turns the banding a fixed step cuts through
 *   a volume into noise. Nothing here accumulates temporally, so it is interleaved
 *   gradient noise rather than blue: designed to be invisible in a still frame, which
 *   is the only kind of invisible that matters for a screenshot.
 * - **Early exit** below one per cent transmittance, since most of a sky is behind
 *   something opaque.
 *
 * ## What is left out, and what it costs
 *
 * Beyond `FAR_FIELD` the sample uses the base shape alone: no detail channels, no
 * erosion, no march toward the light. That is visible as a loss of texture at the far
 * edge of the layer, where the aerial perspective is doing most of the work anyway.
 * The alternative — every sample paying for the detail, as production does — is
 * affordable at two milliseconds on a console and is not affordable here.
 *
 * The march toward the light is five steps at geometrically growing distances rather
 * than the precomputed light volume production uses, because building that volume is
 * a bake of its own and this module already has a two-and-a-half-second bake in it.

 * World units of the planet's surface one repeat of the shape volume covers.
 *
 * The shape volume is addressed by the **direction from the planet's centre**, scaled by
 * `seaRadius / CLOUD_FEATURE` — so its features are this many world units across on the
 * surface, and the field repeats that many times around the equator. The weather map, by
 * contrast, is wrapped around the planet **exactly once**. The ratio being neither an integer
 * nor a simple fraction is the same point it always was: two fields whose periods cannot be
 * locked together are weather, and one field at one scale is wallpaper.
 *
 * **This scales with the radius, and it should not, and the reason is the feature's *angle*.**
 *
 * A direction is a direction on a sphere, so a feature this size subtends `CLOUD_FEATURE /
 * seaRadius` radians **to the player standing under it, at every elevation and every
 * distance** — the one thing about a cloud's size that a ground player reads first. Which
 * makes the angular size and the wrap count the same number: `wraps = 2π / angular`. There is
 * no version of this constant that gives big clouds overhead *and* few repeats, and pretending
 * otherwise is how a planet ends up with one cloud in it.
 *
 * `0.12 · R` is chosen from the ground, upwards. At a twelfth of the radius a feature is
 * 6.9° of arc, so roughly **thirteen** clouds lie between the horizon and the zenith — a sky
 * with weather in it you can point at — and the volume repeats **52.4** times around the
 * equator, which is four times the anti-repetition floor and never near a whole number.
 *
 * The predecessor was `0.6 · R`, put there by 0041's rule that the planet's body scales with
 * its radius. That rule is right for the body and wrong here: the cloud feature is not a
 * feature of the *body*. It is a distance at which weather is recognisable, and the eye
 * standing on the ground is the instrument that measures it. At 0.6 it was 34° of arc, which
 * put **two and a half** clouds in the entire visible hemisphere and one in the whole sky
 * above thirty degrees — technically weather, and not something a person would call weather.
 *
 * The scaling is not `seaRadius²`. Features tile a surface: `N · L² = 4π · seaRadius²`, so
 * holding N fixed makes L proportional to `seaRadius` and holding the *area* fixed is what
 * the square would do. On the second planet `R²` would make one feature twenty radians
 * across — six and a half skies — so that the entire planet was a single cloud.
