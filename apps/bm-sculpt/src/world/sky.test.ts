/**
 * Compiling a material needs no graphics device.
 *
 * Same reasoning as `clouds.test.ts`: the questions worth asking about a shader are
 * the ones that fail silently, and a shader's whole visible output is a colour that
 * only a browser can judge. So these are about structure — does it read the eye, does
 * it read the day, does it fade the discs at the right elevation, does the starfield
 * turn once per cycle — and not about whether the sky is blue.
 *
 * The dome takes the whole `DayNightState` rather than a list of fields, so these can
 * be built from real states at real times of day rather than from hand-picked numbers.
 *
 * One block below steps outside that rule, and the reason is the whole point of it:
 * a starfield that drew *nothing* passed every structural test in this file, because
 * "invisible" is not a shape a shader can be wrong about. So the last block runs the
 * built material on rmsl's CPU target and asserts on the number of pixels it lights —
 * the shader itself rather than a transcription of it, which is what the block was
 * before, and which is what let the starfield be broken at every hour but sunrise.

/**
 * How many pixels the starfield actually lights.
 *
 * The starfield's arithmetic, transcribed from `sky.ts`: the lattice, Dave Hoskins'
 * `hash33`, and the disc measured in **screen pixels** rather than in cells — which is
 * the fix, and the reason this block exists. With the size in cells the whole thing
 * emits perfectly valid GLSL, compiles at every precision, passes the hash-once test
 * and lights **zero** pixels at 640×360.
/**
 * How many pixels the starfield actually lights.
 *
 * These run the **real** `SkyMaterial` — the same built program, the same node graph,
 * the same uniforms — through rmsl's CPU target, and count what came out. That is a
 * deliberate replacement for the transcription that used to be here, which wrote the
 * starfield's arithmetic out again by hand: the lattice, the hash, the disc.
 *
 * **The transcription is what let this bug sit unfixed.** It was written when the
 * starfield was sized as a fraction of a cell, and it omitted the starfield's turn — the
 * rotation about the vertical that carries the field with the hour — because at the time
 * the turn was not part of it. It went on omitting it, so the block measured the sky at
 * `turn = 0` and only `turn = 0`. Sunrise. The cycle starts at sunrise, so the
 * transcription agreed with the shader at the one hour where the shader was right: the
 * numbers it printed were true and the starfield was broken.
 *
 * The bug it could not see: the starfield was handed one direction and used it both to
 * pick the lattice cell and to project the fragment's own ray onto the screen. The first
 * wants the field's own frame and the second wants the world's, and the two are the same
 * direction only when the turn is zero. Everywhere else the shader projected a ray
 * ninety or a hundred and eighty degrees away from the one the pixel was actually
 * looking down, `w` came out negative over most of the frame, and `bothInFront` deleted
 * those stars. Reported as *stars on the right third of the screen at night, and all of
 * them at sunrise*. This block is the assertion that says no: a starfield that lights
 * nothing at nine in the evening, and lights them on one side of the frame only.
 *
 * Nothing is rasterized — `render` evaluates every fragment of the rectangle — so the
 * counts here are of evaluated fragments rather than of covered ones, which for a dome
 * that fills the frame is the same thing.
