/**
 * The field, answered as the four questions a player's physics asks.
 *
 * The player was written against a voxel world with `getSolidAt`/`getGroundHeightAt`
 * samplers. Here there is no grid: there is one signed distance function that the
 * mesher, the picker and this adapter all read, so the ground the player stands on
 * is the ground drawn on screen and the surface an edit digs into — ADR 0009's
 * invariant, extended from the pointer to the body.
 *
 * Two of the four are direct. `getSolidAt` is the sign. `getInWaterAt` is the sea
 * surface outside air. `getGroundDistanceAt` is the only subtle one: because a distance is
 * a *directionless* quantity, "the surface to stand on" is found by walking away
 * from the material — up if the feet are inside it, down if they are over it — and
 * the caller clamps the answer to a step so a stride onto a ledge is told from a
 * wall.
 *
 * ## What changed when up became a function of position
 *
 * - **`getSolidAt` and `getInWaterAt` take a point**, not three numbers. Three scalars were a
 *   tuple with no name, and every one of them was reaching for `.y` to mean "up".
 * - **`getGroundDistanceAt` reports a distance along a supplied `up`**, replacing
 *   `getGroundHeightAt`'s height. "The column at `(x, z)`" is not a thing on a world whose
 *   ground is not level, and the trace has to follow the same ray the player is standing on or
 *   it finds a different surface than the one under their feet.
 * - **`seaLevel` became `seaRadius`.** One number, two meanings, named for the frame in use: an
 *   altitude for a flat world, a distance from the centre for a spherical one. Two fields would
 *   have been worse — there is never a world that has both.
 * - **`heightAt` is gone.** Spawn placement now asks the same question the physics asks, so a
 *   world whose surface has no closed form still spawns the player on it rather than at a
 *   height read from somewhere else.
 *
 * The field is read through a getter rather than held, because `SculptSession`
 * rebuilds it on every committed edit: a cached field would collide the player
 * against a model they have already changed.
