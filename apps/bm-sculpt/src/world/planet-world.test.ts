/**
 * A planet, as a world the streaming layer has to serve.
 *
 * ## What this file is for
 *
 * `planet.test.ts` measures the field. `gate-2-meshing.test.ts` proves the mesher does not notice
 * the field changed shape. Neither proves the thing a player would notice, which is that **standing
 * on a planet produces a world**.
 *
 * On a flat landscape three separate systems happen to agree without being told to: the player
 * spawns on the surface, the streaming window's cells are the cells the player is standing in, and
 * the window holds surface. On a sphere each of those is separately plausible and separately wrong
 * — the spawn can land above the planet, the window can be a ball of cells around a point in space
 * rather than a shell around the surface, and the surface can be somewhere the window never looks.
 * None of the three is a bug in isolation and all three together are an empty world.
 *
 * So this file builds the real `Session` on a real planet, puts a real player on it, and asks the
 * questions a player would.
