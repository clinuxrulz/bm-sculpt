/**
 * The application shell: a canvas, a header, and whichever scene the URL asks for.
 *
 * Three scenes now, and the switch is still a query parameter rather than a build
 * flag. The default is the **game**: a first-person player over the terrain who
 * digs and places with the same stroke machinery the sculptor uses. `?edit` keeps
 * the orbit-and-sculpt view the application grew up as, and `?spike` is the phase
 * 0 diagnostic that proved the renderer, the packed vertex layout and the
 * octahedral fold. A spike behind a build flag is a spike that stops being
 * rebuilt; a game that cannot be put back into the editor it came from is a game
 * whose tools are only ever tested from the outside.
 *
 * The frame loop differs by scene, and deliberately so: the game steps a body and
 * follows it, the editor streams toward an orbit target, and the spike streams
 * nothing. What they share is one renderer and one render call.
