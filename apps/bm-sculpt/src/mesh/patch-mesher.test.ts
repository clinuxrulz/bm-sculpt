/**
 * Meshing a patch, and the assumption its radial band rests on.
 *
 * ## The load-bearing claim
 *
 * `patchBand` derives a patch's radial sample range from the terrain sampled on a `(side + 1)²`
 * corner grid, padded by the largest neighbour-to-neighbour step on that grid times a safety factor.
 * That is only sound if the terrain does not move further *between* two adjacent samples than it
 * does across the grid as a whole.
 *
 * **It is an assumption, and it is checked the only way an assumption like this can honestly be
 * checked: by consequence.** If the band were too narrow anywhere, the terrain there would fall
 * outside the samples and that part of the patch would get no surface — so a hole, permanently,
 * with nothing to re-mesh it. So: mesh patches across an entire planet's surface and require
 * **every one of them to produce geometry**. A narrow band cannot survive that.
 *
 * A unit test of the band arithmetic would pass with a safety factor of zero and tell us nothing.
