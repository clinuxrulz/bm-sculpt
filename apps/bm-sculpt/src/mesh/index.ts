/**
 * The chunk pipeline: turning a streamed region into triangles, on a worker.
 *
 * ## What is here and what is not
 *
 * **The region arithmetic and the worker protocol, and nothing about a field.** This is the half
 * of meshing that knows what a *chunk* is — how many samples it holds, which cell of it a sample
 * belongs to, how a LOD stride divides it — and none of that is meshing. `SurfaceNets` itself,
 * which is what actually turns a distance function into quads, is in
 * `@big-mesh-studios/meshing` with a one-method sampler and no idea a chunk exists.
 *
 * That split is the reason a second application can be meshed by the same code: it brings a
 * different idea of a region, or none, and reaches for the mesher rather than for this (ADR 0024).
 *
 * ## The rule this directory keeps
 *
 * **The worker never reaches back to the main thread.** Everything crossing the boundary is a
 * `ModelMessage` of plain numbers, because the operation list is structured-cloned on every change
 * and a payload holding a class or a closure would arrive at the worker as something else. The
 * assertion is in `worker.test.ts`.
