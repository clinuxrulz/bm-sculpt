/**
 * Building a mesher from a model message, on the worker's side of the boundary.
 *
 * This is the code that makes `ModelMessage` mean something. Everything above it —
 * protocol, worker, pool — is plumbing that assumes this function exists and is honest
 * about what a worker can do; nothing else in the project can check that assumption,
 * because it is the one place where a description becomes a field.
 *
 * It lives in its own file rather than inside `worker.ts` for the same reason the worker
 * is a pure function: this is where the CSG and paint meet the thread boundary, and it
 * needs to be testable without a browser.
 *
 * The rule it exists to enforce: **the worker never reaches back to the main thread.**
 * It is handed a description and builds everything it needs from it, which is why the
 * description carries serialised operations and paint buffers rather than live objects.
