/**
 * The messages between the main thread and a meshing worker.
 *
 * Three rules govern this file, and all three follow from one fact: a worker is not a
 * place you can ask a question.
 *
 * **Everything a worker needs arrives in a message.** The operations, the paint and the
 * base field cannot be reached across the thread boundary, so the main thread sends them
 * and the worker rebuilds its own field on its own side. A worker holding a reference to
 * "the" field would be sharing mutable state with a thread that cannot be synchronised,
 * and the main thread's edits would never be seen.
 *
 * **Cloned going out, transferred coming back.** The model is small relative to a mesh
 * and is copied. The mesh is large and its buffers are transferred, so ownership moves
 * rather than being duplicated — which is why `ChunkMeshBuilder.finish` copies to exact
 * length: a transferred *view* would be detached in flight and the main thread would
 * receive an empty array, silently, having been told the transfer succeeded.
 *
 * **Every request carries a generation.** A chunk can be re-requested before its previous
 * answer has arrived — the player walked, or a stroke invalidated it — and answers come
 * back out of order, because workers run in parallel and one chunk takes arbitrarily
 * longer than another. The generation is how the main thread tells a late answer from a
 * current one. A counter, not a timestamp: it only has to be compared, and a counter
 * cannot repeat.

 * cannot re-issue is a pool that never works again, because `Session.idle` stays false
