/**
 * The globe's shader, compiled.
 *
 * ## Why compile it here
 *
 * A globe is the one part of this project whose failure is invisible until somebody flies up, and
 * then it is total: a black planet, or a planet of flat grey with a silhouette that does not match
 * the ground it replaced. Neither is a bug a unit test catches by calling a function — the
 * interesting part is the graph, and the graph is what `compileGlsl` renders to text.
 *
 * So the assertions are about the generated shader, which is the artifact the player sees:
 *
 * - **The equirectangular inverse is in there, twice** — once in the vertex stage for displacement
 *   and once in the fragment stage for the normal and the colour. One occurrence would mean the two
 *   stages read the map at different places, which is a planet whose shading slides off its terrain.
 * - **The height map is read three times in the fragment stage**: the point, and one neighbour along
 *   each surface tangent. Fewer than three is a normal that is not a gradient.
 * - **The displacement is in the vertex stage**, because that is the only stage where a displaced
 *   sphere is cheap: the fragment stage cannot move a vertex.
