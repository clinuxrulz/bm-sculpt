/**
 * The planet as two triangles.
 *
 * ## What this is
 *
 * Streamed chunks cannot show a whole planet. Measured: at planet scale a cubic window spends most
 * of its budget on deep rock — most of any large volume of space near a planet is *inside* the
 * planet — so the reachable surface is bounded by the window no matter how much of it exists.
 *
 * Past the altitude where the streamed chunks stop resolving detail, this is cheaper *and* more
 * accurate than the chunks it replaces. The maps come from `bakePlanetMaps` in `@big-mesh/csg`,
 * which reads the same field the chunks do, so the sphere's silhouette is the terrain's and its
 * colour is the terrain's.
 *
 * ## The two things that make the swap invisible
 *
 * 1. **The same lighting and the same fog as the terrain**, term for term, from the same `SkyLight`,
 *    `Fog` and `PointLights`. A globe lit by its own sun and hazed by its own atmosphere is a second
 *    opinion about what the light is doing, and it disagrees at exactly one altitude: the one the
 *    player is watching.
 * 2. **The relief is real.** The height map displaces the mesh and is differentiated per fragment
 *    into a normal, so the mountains catch the low sun the way the chunked ones do.
 *
 * ## Why the normal comes from the map rather than from the mesh
 *
 * A displaced sphere's mesh normals are the normals of a coarse tessellation — at 256 segments the
 * facet is about a hundred units across, which is coarser than the mountains, so shading them
 * gives a faceted rock rather than a landscape. Differentiating the height map per fragment costs
 * two extra texture reads and a cross product, and gets the terrain's own slope.
