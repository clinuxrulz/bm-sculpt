/**
 * Gate 2: does a radial field survive the existing meshing machinery unchanged?
 *
 * The chunk structure this plan settled on is the one already in the tree: a **cubic lattice
 * with a fixed 320-unit footprint at every level of detail**, re-centred on the planet.
 * Nothing about the seam rule, the overlap mask, Surface Nets or the slot pool assumes a
 * height field, so the test is whether the *field* can be radial without any of them
 * noticing. It should not be able to tell.
 *
 * ## The cells are found rather than written down
 *
 * The surface's radius is `R + scale·(base + 2·ridge·mask)`, and `base` is bounded by ±1 while
 * `ridge·mask` is in `[0, 1]`, so the surface lies between `R − 96` and `R + 288` — a band of
 * 384 units centred well *above* the nominal radius. A first attempt hardcoded cell
 * `(12, 0, 0)` on the reasoning that `12 · 320 = 3840` is near `R = 4000`; that cell spans
 * `x ∈ [3680, 4000]` and so holds surface only where the terrain dips, and it meshed empty.
 * The three cells below are searched for instead, each chosen for the angle its surface
 * normal makes with the lattice axes, which is the only thing that differs about them.
