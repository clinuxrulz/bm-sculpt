/**
 * Gate 1: is there a usable noise domain for a sphere?
 *
 * The planet field is `|p - c| - (R + scale·g)` where `g` is the landscape's shape read
 * from a direction. This file measures each candidate domain in `domains.ts`, because the
 * answer decided the shape of `perlin3.ts` and would otherwise have been an assumption.
 *
 * ## What the first draft of this file got wrong, and what replaced it
 *
 * It tested **continuity** — "is `g` continuous in the direction?" — and expected the
 * cube-face domain to fail it. It does not, and the reason is worth stating because it
 * removed a worry rather than adding one: **every one of these domains is continuous as a
 * function of world position.** The mesher never asks a domain for a height, it asks the
 * *field* for a distance at a world position, and two chunks either side of a seam ask for
 * the same position and get the same answer. There is no seam crack to avoid. My original
 * note claiming a cube-face "step" was measuring two identical directions and calling the
 * difference zero a step.
 *
 * So continuity is not the requirement. What a 2D domain actually costs is:
 *
 * 1. **Repetition.** The argument is drawn from one `[-1, 1]²` several times over, so whole
 *    neighbourhoods of the sphere read the *same* landscape. A cube-face domain maps all six
 *    axis directions to `(0, 0)`; the dominant-axis domain maps all three of them to `(0, 0)`.
 * 2. **Collapse.** A direction whose argument vanishes drags its whole neighbourhood to one
 *    value, which is repetition again at a smaller scale.
 *
 * 3D noise of the direction pays neither, because it needs no chart: a 2D domain has to name
 * a sphere with two numbers, which cannot be done without a chart, and every chart repeats.

 * Take a point `n`, step a fixed angle `α` away from it in several directions, and measure

 * answer wherever `n` is, so the ratio of the largest to the smallest is 1. A domain that
 * does not gives a ratio that is large, or infinite when some direction moves the argument
 * not at all.
 *
 * This is the sharpest statement of why two dimensions cannot carry a sphere, and it is
 * worth stating as a measurement because it is not obvious: **a 2D chart is blind to the
 * direction normal to itself, at every point.** A chart is a projection and a projection has
 * a kernel. Near the place where the chart's normal lines up with a direction you can walk,
 * the argument stops changing, so a whole region of the planet is one point of noise. For a
 * cube-face map that region is at each pole; for a single projection, at both; for the
 * dominant-axis domain, at all six axis directions. Three dimensions have no chart, so they
 * have no normal, so they have no blind direction.
