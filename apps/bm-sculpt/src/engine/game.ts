/**
 * The game loop: where the player, the input, the camera and the streamed world
 * meet once a frame.
 *
 * The pieces below are each testable alone — the physics against a sampler, the
 * field against the mesher, the stroke against the document — and this is the
 * seam that wires them, which is the part that is not automatically correct just
 * because each side is. The order in `tick` carries two decisions worth naming.
 *
 * **The player steps before the camera is placed.** The camera is put where the
 * player is, so a frame that drew first would show the previous frame's position
 * — most visible as a one-frame lag on a fast fall.
 *
 * **The window follows the player, not the camera.** Streaming is anchored to the
 * body, so looking around does not scroll the world and a fast pan does not drag
 * the streaming window with it. The field is defined everywhere, so the cost of
 * looking the wrong way is only that the chunk behind the eye is meshed.
 *
 * Nothing here draws. The caller owns the frame loop and the render call, so the
 * same engine can be driven by a browser animation frame, a test, or a headless
 * benchmark.
